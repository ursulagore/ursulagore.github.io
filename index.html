	<h1> HTML Excercises </H1>
<p> The purpose of this excercise is to put the lessons learned from previous excercies together to build a web page of your own </p>
<h2> Previously... </h2>
<ul>
	<li> You looked at the HTML that made up a <a href='http://edinburgh.codefirstgirls.org.uk/courses/html/exercises.html'> sample page </a>
		<li> You looked at the HTML that made up one of your favourite sites </li>
		<li> You changed the attribute of an img tag to change the picture it showed </li>
	</ul>
		<h3> Now... </h3>
		<p> You should: </p>
		<ol>
			<li> Look at the picture of this site </li>
			<li> Try and match up the look of the site to HTML that you've seen so far </li>
			<li> Now build that HTML in your own index.html page </li>
			<li> Check the page in a web browser to see how it compares </li>
			<li> Look back to the slides if you want to </li>
		</ol>

			<p> Here's a picture of a cat </p>
